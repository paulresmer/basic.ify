        <b>how is my grade calculated?</b>
        <p>your grade is calculated by averaging the popularity indices of your 10 most listened-to artists
            over the last six months. each artist's popularity index is based, for the most part, on the total number of
            plays their tracks have had and how recent those plays are.</p>
        <b>my top artists don't look right! what happened?</b>
        <p>undergroundify accesses data collected by Spotify through calls to the Spotify API. since these data
            collection methods are not available to the public, it is impossible to say why certain users may experience
            discrepancies between their undergroundify results and their actual listening history. it is worth noting
            that since a lot of data collected by Spotify is not updated to the API in real time, a few days of lag is
            common before your undergroundify data is updated.</p>
        <b>will underground.ify support apple music / other platforms in the future?</b>
        <p>anything is possible! (let us cook)</p>
        <b>how was underground.ify created?</b>
        <p>underground.ify is an open-source tool. you can view its source code <a
                href="https://github.com/paulresmer/underground.ify">here</a>.</p>
