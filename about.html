        <p>basic.ify is a tool that allows users to examine the uniqueness of their music taste;
            i.e., how "basic" they are.

        <b>how is my grade calculated?</b>
        <p>your grade is calculated by averaging the popularity indices of your 10 most listened-to artists
            over the last six months. each artist's popularity index is based, for the most part, on the total number of
            plays their tracks have had and how recent those plays are.</p>

        <br>
        <b>my top artists don't look right! what happened?</b>
        <p>basic.ify accesses data collected by Spotify through calls to the Spotify API. since these data
            collection methods are not available to the public, it is impossible to say why certain users may experience
            discrepancies between their basic.ify results and their actual listening history. it is worth noting
            that since a lot of data collected by Spotify is not updated to the API in real time, a few days of lag is
            to be expected before your basic.ify data is updated.</p>

        <br>
        <b>will basic.ify support apple music / other platforms in the future?</b>
        <p>anything is possible! (let us cook)</p>

        <br>
        <b>how was basic.ify created?</b>
        <p>basic.ify is an open-source tool. you can view its source code <a
                href="https://github.com/paulresmer/basic.ify">here</a>.</p>
